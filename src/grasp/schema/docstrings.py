"""Tiny Google-style docstring parser for the schema exporter.

Handles the two things the exporter needs from a dataclass:

- ``stage_help(cls)``: the summary paragraph at the top of the class
  docstring, used as stage-level help.
- ``field_help(cls)``: a ``{field_name: help_text}`` map extracted from
  the ``Attributes:`` block.

Deliberately narrow: not a general Google-style parser. If a docstring
doesn't have an ``Attributes:`` block, :func:`field_help` returns an
empty dict.
